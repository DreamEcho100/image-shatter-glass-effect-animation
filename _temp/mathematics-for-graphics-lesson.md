Class: Mathematics for Graphics
Introduction to Basic Geometry
Geometry forms the foundation of graphics programming. We'll start by understanding key geometric concepts such as points, vertices, and triangles. These elements are fundamental building blocks for creating shapes and objects in a digital environment.

Understanding Points and Vertices
Points represent individual coordinates in 2D space, while vertices are points that define the corners of shapes or polygons. We'll explore how these points and vertices are represented in code and how they're used to construct objects on the canvas.

Defining Triangles
Triangles are the simplest polygonal shape, consisting of three vertices connected by straight lines. Understanding how to define and manipulate triangles is crucial for creating complex shapes and surfaces in graphics programming.

Calculating Triangle Properties
We'll delve into the mathematics behind triangles, including techniques for calculating properties such as area, perimeter, centroid, and bounding box. These calculations play a key role in various graphics operations, including collision detection and rendering.

Exploring Randomness and Variation
Introducing randomness into graphics can add a sense of dynamism and naturalness to animations and effects. We'll explore techniques for generating random values within specified ranges and applying variations to create more organic and interesting visuals.

Applying Clipping and Transformations
Clipping allows us to restrict the visible area of shapes on the canvas, while transformations enable us to manipulate the position, rotation, and scale of objects. We'll learn how to use the canvas's 2D context to apply clipping masks and transformations to shapes and images.

Extra Tips and Tricks:
Useful Libraries: Explore libraries like three.js or PixiJS for more advanced 3D graphics and interactive experiences.
Vector Mathematics: Understanding vector operations such as addition, subtraction, dot product, and cross product can greatly enhance your ability to manipulate objects in 2D and 3D space.
Optimization Techniques: Implement techniques like spatial partitioning (e.g., quad trees) and level of detail (LOD) to optimize performance when dealing with large numbers of objects or complex scenes.
Shader Programming: Dive into shader programming with WebGL or WebGL2 for highly customizable and performant graphics effects, such as shaders for lighting, shadows, and post-processing.
Conclusion:
Mathematics forms the backbone of graphics programming, empowering developers to create visually stunning and interactive experiences. By mastering the principles of geometry, randomness, clipping, and transformations, you'll be well-equipped to tackle a wide range of graphics challenges and unleash your creativity on the canvas. Get ready to bring your digital creations to life through the power of mathematics!
